# Project Overview
Ailence (Artificial Intelligence Learning Ecosystem, New Creative Edge) is a multifaceted platform built around five key pillars:
1. AI-driven learning for schools and universities.
2. An earning system that rewards contributors with shares.
3. A trading platform for buying and selling those shares.
4. Social media features.
5. A suite of mind games.


This repository contains four main components used to build Ailence's platform.

## 1. `app`
A Flutter application targeting all major platforms. This folder holds the protected pages available to authenticated users. It depends on packages such as `graphql_flutter`, `get`, and various UI libraries. Build the application using the standard Flutter tooling (`flutter run` for development, `flutter build` for release). Platform-specific directories were removed from this repository but can be regenerated with `flutter create .`.

## 2. `frontend`
##### it's the project website homepage
Public website built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. It exposes marketing pages and other unauthenticated content for `ailence.ai` and `ailence.com`. Use `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn dev` to start the development server. Production bundles are created with `yarn build`.
The `src` folder is organized as follows:
- `components/` with reusable UI elements such as `headerNav.vue`, `appFooter.vue`, and `calculator.vue`.
- `views/` provides pages like `HomeView.vue`, `terms.vue`, and `privacy.vue`.
- `utils/` contains the Vue router (`router.js`) and translation helpers (`translation.js`).
- `assets/` holds static images.
Entry files `App.vue` and `main.js` bootstrap the app.


## 3. `backend`
Serverless backend running on Cloudflare Workers. It exposes a GraphQL API defined under `src/graphql`. Durable objects (see `src/durable`) handle trade and task functionality. Databases are configured in `wrangler.toml` using Cloudflare D1. Tests are defined under `test` and run via `npm test` (Vitest). Secrets like `MAILTRAP_TOKEN` and Google OAuth credentials must be added with `wrangler secret put <NAME>` for production or configured in `[vars]` for local development.

Key directories under `src` include:
- `graphql/` with the schema builder and resolvers (`builder.ts`, `query.ts`, `mutate.ts`).
- `durable/` providing durable objects `trade.ts` and `task.ts`.
- `libs/` containing business logic modules (`admin.ts`, `auth.ts`, `shares.ts`, `study.ts`, `user.ts`, `work.ts`).
- `utils/` for common helpers like `check_auth.ts` and `error.ts`.
- `db/` with SQL files that define D1 tables.
The entry point `index.ts` configures the GraphQL server, and tests live in the `test/` folder.

## 4. `panal`
Admin panel powered by Quasar and Vue. It includes pages for user and task management. Install dependencies with `yarn`, then launch with `yarn dev`. Quasar's configuration lives in `quasar.config.js`.
The Quasar `src` directory contains:
- `pages/` such as `user.vue`, `task.vue`, and `curriculum.vue` for managing app data.
- `layouts/` with the main layout (`MainLayout.vue`).
- `router/` defining client routes.
- `boot/` for initialization scripts (`apollo.js` and `google.js`).
- `apollo/` where the GraphQL client is configured.
Static assets reside in `public/`, and configuration is handled by `quasar.config.js`.


## Development Tips
- Node 18+ is required for `frontend`, `backend`, and `panal`.
- Flutter 3.6+ is required for the `app` folder.
- Run `npm install` in each Node-based folder before running scripts.
- Tests in `backend` use Cloudflare's Worker environment and may require additional setup.
